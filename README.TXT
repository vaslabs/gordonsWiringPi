wiringPi README
===============

Please note that the official way to get wiringPi is via git from
git.drogon.net and not GitHub.

ie.

  git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi

The version of wiringPi held on GitHub by "Gadgetoid" is used to build the
wiringPython, Ruby, Perl, etc. wrappers for these other languages. 

----------------Pi-web-agent team------------------------------------------------------
The version of wiringPi held on Github by "vaslabs" contains changes to serve
the pi-web-agent. Those changes involve mainly outputing json format information to be
used by the pi-web-agent API.

The pi-web-agent team does not guarantee that this version of wiringPi will maintain
the same functionality as the official Drogon release outside of the pi-web-agent.

If you want this project to use it on the command line or purposes outside the pi-web-agent
you should get it from the official Drogon repository. The pi-web-agent however, is not compatible with
the official wiringPi since it lacks json format results.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This version may lag the official Drogon release.  Pull requests may not be
accepted to Github....

Please see

  http://wiringpi.com/

for the official documentation, etc. and the best way to submit bug reports, etc.
is by sending an email to projects@drogon.net

Thanks!
